# hello-world
Just a new repository to start off in github ;)

Hi fellow earthlings!
Mikee here, just starting off at github but I doubt a lot of people really did read through that entire introduction repository. The fact that I'm even writing a lot here just says how much of an obedient person I am.. but really, I just don't know where to start off with this. Like-- what language do you use here? I'm sure I'll find out sooner. Talk to you soon.
